parse json with python - reads the dialouge box and runs it through spellcheck


-New plan: custom parser for noppes's bs
write json parser class that can use relaxedjson, actual json and whatever the fuck noppes is using

THEN do spell checking

ffs it's almost easier to just to manually check the files
